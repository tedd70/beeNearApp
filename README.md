# beeNearApp
For the beeNearClientApp application we can use "npm install" then, "npm start" where? In the terminal on your code editor.
For this part of application I used Angular8 with Typescript.


For the backend part I used .NETCore with EntityFramework.
For this part we need only to run the project and after that we will see in the browser(in swagger) all the api in the aplication.

For database I used SqlManagemantServerStudio2018.
